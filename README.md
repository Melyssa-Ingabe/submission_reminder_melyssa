# Submission Reminder App

This is a simple shell-based application that helps track student assignment submissions and sends reminders for pending work.

The app creates a directory named `submission_reminder_{yourName}`

## Scripts:

### 1. create_environment.sh
Use this script to automatically generate the directory structure and necessary files.

### 2. Copilot_shell_script.sh
It will ask for the name used during environment creation (e.g. Melyssa).
Ask for a new assignment name.
Update config.env with the new assignment.
Run startup.sh to show who hasnâ€™t submitted that assignment.

#### How to run
./create_environment.sh
./copilot_shell_script.sh
